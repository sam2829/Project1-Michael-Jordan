                    Jordan shares this with Scottie Pippen. But MJ was the undisputed leader of the Bulls team that went
                    6-0 in NBA Finals
                    with two 3-peats. Any team in history will attest that winning two straight NBA titles is such a
                    heroic feat, let alone
                    three. And the fact that MJ did it twice... is something that is extraordinary.

                    In game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals Michael Jordan battled through food poisening to score 38 points
                    and
                    lead his team to victory.

                    At the ripe age of 35 years old, MJ managed a haul of impressive team and individual achievements.
                    In
                    fact, he managed
                    to capture the most important achievements of all.MJ captured the NBA title and Finals MVP in an
                    iconic season where he was also the MVP of the league and of the All-Star
                    game. In a nutshell, MJ was basically far and away the best player on planet Earth at age 35.

                    In 1987-1988, Michael Jordan captured a record that has remained until today. In fact, it may last
                    for eternity. We have
                    not seen a player be as dominant on both ends of the floor since Michael Jordan. He won the scoring
                    title and the DPOY
                    in one year, something extraordinary and special. Of course, after an impressive season like that,
                    MJ deservedly won the
                    MVP.
